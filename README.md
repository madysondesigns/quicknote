# QuickNote

A simple note that lives in a new browser tab. I typically am already in a browser or have it available, so that's where I want to jot something down quickly.

## Installing QuickNote

Copy the HTML file wherever you want it. Locally, on your server, wherever. It's just the one file (favicon optional). #simplicity

## Using QuickNote

Option A: Set QuickNote as your browser's new tab page.
Option B: Set up a bookmark (bonus points for keyboard shortcut)

Whenever you need to jot something down, open QuickNote and type away. Use the buttons to copy the contents of your note, or to clear the note and start new.

Uses LocalStorage to save your note over accidental refreshes, tab closes, or browser restarts.

Inserts the date you created a note at the top. If you're like me, you leave notes open in browser tabs for far too long. 

## About QuickNote

I wrote this quickly so I can give up Post-It notes. I hate Post-It notes.
